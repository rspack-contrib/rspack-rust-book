# Getting Started

Welcome to _Rspack Custom Binding_! This guide will help you get started with creating your own native _Node.js addon_ for Rspack.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into _Rspack Custom Binding_, we recommend:

1. **Read the [Rationale](./rationale.md)** - Understand why you might want to use custom bindings and how they work
2. **Basic Rust Knowledge** - Familiarity with [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)
3. **Node.js Experience** - Understanding of [Node.js addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) and [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) concepts

If you are not familiar with writing _Node.js addons_ and _N-API_ in Rust, don't worry. We will cover the basics in the guide.

## Next Steps

Once you understand the rationale and architecture, proceed to the [Create From Template](./create-from-template.md) guide to set up your development environment.
